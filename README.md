How to Git

Each Repository has a Main Branch, which is, well, the main one.
If i want to to some changes on my code, i do create a new Branch.
A Branch copies the Main at this exact time, and lets you edit it.
If somebody has changed something in Main while you are working on another Branch, you may pull those updates to your Branch.
If you are done with your Branch, your changes get Merged with Main.
If you safe your changes, this is called commit.
Each commit has a commit Message, where you type in why youÂ´ve made those changes.
This helps everyone to understand what is happening.
