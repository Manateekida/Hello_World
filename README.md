How to Git

Each Repository has a Main Branch, which is, well, the main one.
If i want to to some changes on my code, i do create a new Branch.
A Branch copies the Main at this exact time, and lets you edit it.
If somebody has changed something in Main while you are working on another Branch, you may pull those updates to your Branch.
If you are done with your Branch, your changes get Merged with Main.
If you safe your changes, this is called commit.
Each commit has a commit Message, where you type in why you´ve made those changes.
This helps everyone to understand what is happening.

If you´re done you can open a pull request.
This is done at the pull-request tab and then new pull request.
Choose what you want to compare, f.e. Main with Readme_Edits.
Your changes are markes in red and green.
Check if everythiong is right, GitHub also tells you if everything could be fine.
When you´re happy, create a pull request and describe it.

After that you can merge that pull request with main.
Click on Merge Pull Request and confirm.
You may delete your branch now, if you wish.

That´s it for now, have fun! :)
